            <p>I have always been a hard worker. You know the type... show up early, stay late, come in on the weekends. 
            I was always responsible and saved money, took minimal risks and honestly as a result, had minimal fun.
            This all changed when I was dating my husband. His mom moved to Oahu the previous year and he thought it was 
            time for a visit. Most people would be exstatic and already packed. I was a skeptic. It's expensive, 
            we diidn't have the money, blah, blah, blah. You name the excuse and I came up with it. 
            The night before we left I was a mess, the luggage was too heavy, we were going to get charged more... 
            why are we even going? After a while he finally calmed me down and we finished packing.</p>

            <p>The next day we hopped on our nonstop flight and landed in Oahu. From the second I stepped off the plane 
            I was never the same. I dont know if it was the tropical warmth, the smell of hibisucs in the air 
            or what it was exaclty. I imediatly felt the stress and worry leave my body and I have not been the same. 
            Now I live for travel and the next great adventure. This blog is a taste of some of the adventures we have 
            taken along with some easy travel tip to make your next trip unforgettable.<br>
            Remember...TAKE THE TRIP, ALWAYS, TAKE THE TRIP!!</p>
